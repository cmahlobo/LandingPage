      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Think about what you had to eat for your last lunch, and hold that image steadily in your mind. I'm betting
         most of you can picture it perfectly, down to the last condiment. Now think about the last time
        that you skipped lunch, whether you forgot it at home, had a meeting, or simply didn't have the time.
        How did that affect your day? Did you find yourself feeling low-energy? Cranky? Distracted? </p><br>
      <p>Imagine not being able to remember the last lunch you ate this entire month; the simple reason being that you couldn/'t 
        afford it. For most, lunchtime in school was a time to socialize;
        trading snacks, talking about hobbies, and planning meetups with friends.
        All over something that we all had in common -lunch. For thousands of children across the country,
        this is the sad reality. When presented with this problem, we immediately sat down and began to try to solve it.

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
    
      <p>To solve a problem as complex as this, we ended up creating LunchMeet. LunchMeet started as
          an idea that we had to allow our close friends and venture capitalists to donate to a couple of
          schools that we chose to sponsor. It wasn't until we'd presented a particular midwest school a check 
          two summers ago, that a teacher approached me after the ceremony and changed my life forever.
          Instead of only offering to help a select few, and soliciting from a select few - why not make a platform
          that can help everyone donate and expose the need for help in all locations?
